I am a passionate environmental scientist and researcher specializing in geospatial analysis, disaster management, and climate risk assessment. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the IRIS Lab, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), where I develop advanced remote sensing and machine learning algorithms to address environmental challenges. My recent projects include building deep learning-based methods for wildfire burned area estimation using Sentinel-1 data and modeling post-fire vegetation recovery using machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.

Previously, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at the Bangladesh Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO), where I contributed to flood risk mapping using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques and created flood inundation maps using Google Earth Engine for vulnerable regions in Bangladesh. I also served as a Research Assistant at Jahangirnagar University, where I conducted field surveys and baseline studies aligned with World Bank guidelines.

My academic journey has been equally exciting. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Environmental Science and Engineering at UNIST, with a focus on leveraging geospatial tools and machine learning for sustainable environmental management. I also hold an M.S. in Environmental Sciences from Jahangirnagar University, where my thesis focused on flood risk mapping in Bangladeshâ€™s Rangpur Division. My undergraduate project involved analyzing forest cover change using remote sensing data and its impact on sustainability.

I am particularly interested in integrating geospatial technologies and machine learning to solve critical environmental challenges. My work spans applications such as flood risk assessment, vegetation monitoring, and disaster resilience. I enjoy exploring innovative solutions that bridge technology and environmental science, with an emphasis on creating real-world impact.
