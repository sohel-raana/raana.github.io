I am an environmental scientist and researcher specializing in geospatial analysis, disaster management, and climate risk assessment. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the IRIS Lab, **UNIST**, where I develop remote sensing and machine learning algorithms for wildfire estimation and vegetation recovery.

Previously, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at **SPARRSO**, contributing to flood risk mapping using multi-criteria decision-making and Google Earth Engine. I also served as a Research Assistant at **Jahangirnagar University**, conducting field studies aligned with World Bank guidelines.

I hold an **M.S. in Environmental Science and Engineering** from UNIST and an **M.S. in Environmental Sciences** from Jahangirnagar University. My research interests focus on integrating geospatial technologies and machine learning to address critical environmental challenges, including disaster resilience and climate risk assessment.
